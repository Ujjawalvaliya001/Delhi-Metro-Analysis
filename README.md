Post Title: 🎉 Excited to Share My Latest Project! 🚇

📝 Post Content :- I am thrilled to announce the successful completion of the Delhi Metro Analysis Project! This project allowed me to explore and analyze the operational efficiency and ridership patterns of one of the largest metro network in Delhi.

🔑 Key Highlights:

Conducted in-depth data analysis to assess performance metrics.
Developed insights to enhance user experience and operational efficiency.
Collaborated with a talented team to ensure project success.
I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Aman Kharwal Sir for his invaluable guidance and support throughout this journey. Your mentorship has been instrumental in my growth and understanding of the subject.
Looking forward to applying these insights in future projects!

Analyzing the metro network in a city like Delhi helps improve urban transportation infrastructure, leading to better city planning and enhanced commuter experiences. Below is the process we can follow for the task of Metro Network Analysis of Delhi:

1. Determine what you want to achieve. It could be optimizing routes, reducing congestion, improving passenger flow, or understanding travel patterns.
2. Collect data on metro lines, stations, connections, and transit schedules.
3. Clean the data for inconsistencies, missing values, or errors.
4. Create visual representations of the network, such as route maps, passenger flow charts, or heat maps of station congestion.
5. Analyze how effectively the network handles passenger traffic and meets operational targets.

Metro Network Analysis involves the application of data science techniques to understand and interpret the characteristics and dynamics of metro systems.

The provided dataset contains detailed information about the Delhi Metro network, one of the largest and busiest urban transit systems in the world. 

Key features of the dataset include:

* Station Information: Names and IDs of metro stations.
* Geographical Coordinates: Latitude and longitude of each station.
* Line Information: The specific metro line each station belongs to.
* Distance Data: The distance of each station from the start of its line.
* Station Layout: Type of station layout (e.g., Elevated, Underground, At-Grade).
* Opening Date: Date of inauguration of each station.


Task is:----->

1. Map the stations to visualize the coverage and distribution of the metro network across Delhi.
2. Examine characteristics of different metro lines, including station count and average distances between stations.
3. Analyze the types of station layouts and their distribution across the network.
4. Draw statistical correlations and insights, such as the relationship between station layout and distance from the city centre.
